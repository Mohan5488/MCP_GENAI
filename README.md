Here's a **refined and professional version** of your README for GitHub, formatted in Markdown, with clear structure and added steps for generating an SMTP App Password (assuming you're using Gmail or similar providers).

# ‚úâÔ∏è MCP Mail Agent

## Overview

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI: just as USB-C allows universal hardware connections, MCP enables seamless integration between LLMs and external tools or data sources.

This project demonstrates how to use MCP to build intelligent agents capable of sending emails by selecting the appropriate tool using context provided to an LLM.

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **User provides input:** e.g., *email content* and *recipient address*.
2. **MCP retrieves available tools.**
3. **LLM selects the most appropriate tool** (in this case, the email-sending tool).
4. **The tool uses SMTP protocol** to send the email using the provided credentials and context.

## üîê How to Get SMTP App Password (Gmail Example)

Gmail doesn‚Äôt allow direct password access via SMTP. Instead, use an **App Password**:

> ‚úÖ **Precondition:** Two-factor authentication (2FA) must be enabled on your Google Account.

### Steps:

1. Go to [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Under **‚ÄúSigning in to Google‚Äù**, enable **2-Step Verification** if it's not already enabled.
3. Once enabled, go back to the **Security** section.
4. Click on **App passwords**.
5. Sign in again if prompted.
6. Select:

   * **App:** Mail
   * **Device:** Your custom app name (e.g., "MCP Mail Agent")
7. Click **Generate**.
8. Copy the **16-digit password** shown and store it securely (you‚Äôll use it in your `.env` file).

Let me know if you want this customized for another email provider (e.g., Outlook, Yahoo) or deployed as a HuggingFace Space / Docker container.
